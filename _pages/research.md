* Application of Quantum-inspired algorithm to massive MIMO detection
  * Implemented the optimization algorithm inspired by **quantum computing for large MIMO detection**. Developed GNU Radio block based on this algorithm and evaluated using software-defined radios (SDRs).

* Reinforcement Learning-based Adversarial Attack on Neural Networks for Wireless Human Activity Recognition
  * Developed **an attack scheme to degrade deep learning-based human activity recognition (HAR) using Wi-Fi signals** by manipulating pilot signals from user devices. To overcome the limitation of the gradient-based attack method, which requires knowledge of future channel information, proposed a **generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)**-based algorithm that imitates the gradient-based attack without these assumptions, successfully degrading HAR model performance.

* Modulation Classification for Intelligent spectrum sensing
  * Participated in the **IARPA-funded intelligent spectrum sensing project, leading a modulation classification part for Wi-Fi 6 and 5G signals**. The project aims to identify anomaly signals  Developed a preprocessing algorithm for deep learning-based classification without preamble or control channel information. Implemented **PHY layer channels for 5G and Wi-Fi 6** using MATLAB toolboxes and demonstrated that our proposed algorithm reliably identifies modulation of practical OFDM signals using **SDR**.
